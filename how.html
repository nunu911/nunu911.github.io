					<pre>You are the one girl
					And you know that it's true
					I'm feeling younger
					Every time that I'm alone with you
					We were sitting in a parked car
					Stealing kisses in the front yard
					We got questions we should not ask but
					How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
					It's just something that I want to do
					I'll be taking my time, spending my life
					Falling deeper in love with you
					So tell me that you love me too
					In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
					Love flows deeper than the river
					Every moment that I spend with you
					We were sat upon our best friend's roof
					I had both of my arms round you
					Watching the sunrise replace the moon
					How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
					It's just something that I want to do
					I'll be taking my time, spending my life
					Falling deeper in love with you
					So tell me that you love me too
					We were sitting in a parked car
					Stealing kisses in the front yard
					We got questions we shouldn not ask
					How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
					It's just something that I want to do
					I'll be taking my time, spending my life
					Falling deeper in love with you
					So tell me that you love me too
					Tell me that you love me too
					Tell me that you love me too<br><br>
