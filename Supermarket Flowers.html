				I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill<br>
				I threw the day old tea from the cup<br>
				Packed up the photo album Matthew had made<br>
				Memories of a life that's been loved<br>
				Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals<br>
				Poured the old ginger beer down the sink<br>
				Dad always told me, "don't you cry when you're down"<br>
				But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink<br>
				Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know<br>
				A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved<br>
				So I'll sing Hallelujah<br>
				You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br>
				When I fell down you'd be there holding me up<br>
				Spread your wings as you go<br>
				And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah<br>
				You're home<br>
				I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up<br>
				Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case<br>
				John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek<br>
				And wiped a tear from the side of my face<br>
				I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know<br>
				A life with love is a life that's been lived<br>
				So I'll sing Hallelujah<br>
				You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br>
				When I fell down you'd be there holding me up<br>
				Spread your wings as you go<br>
				And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah<br>
				You're home<br>
				Hallelujah
				You were an angel in the shape of my mum<br>
				You got to see the person that I have become<br>
				Spread your wing<br>
				And I know that when God took you back he said Hallelujah<br>
				You're home<br>
